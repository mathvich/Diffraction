# Diffraction
This is a Qt project for physical modeling and visualization of light diffraction by two slits.
Consists simple example of physics calculations (integral of brightness with complex numbers take into account the phase) and 2D visualization of brightness on the plane screen.

built on Qt Creator 5.5.1
